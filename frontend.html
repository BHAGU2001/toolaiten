        <h3>Brain.js</h3>              
    </div> 
    <div class="info-card-body">
      <p><b>1.</b><b>Brain.js</b> is a JavaScript library for building neural networks. It can be used to create AI-driven features in frontend applications, such as predictive text or recommendation systems.<br>
        <h4><b>How to use Brain.js for new user</b></h4>
        <b>1.</b>Installation:
        First, you need to include Brain.js in your project. You can do this by either downloading the library from its GitHub repository or by installing it via npm:
        <pre><code><b>npm install brain.js</b></code></pre>
        </i>Once installed, you can include it in your HTML file using a 'script' tag if your're working in a  web browser environment .<br>
        <b>2.</b>Create a Neural Network:
        After including Brain.js, you need to create a neural network. You can define the structure of the neural network based on the requirements of your application, such as the number of input nodes, hidden layers, and output nodes. For example:
        <pre style ><code><b>const brain = require('brain.js');<br>const net = new brain.NeuralNetwork();</b></code></pre><br>
        <b>3.</b>Training Data:
        Next, you need to prepare your training data. This data should consist of input-output pairs that the neural network will use to learn patterns. Make sure your training data is well-organized and represents the problem you're trying to solve. For example, if you're building a predictive text application, your input could be a sequence of characters, and the output could be the next character in the sequence.<br>
        <b>4.</b>Training the Neural Network:
        Once you have your training data, you can train the neural network using the train() method. This method takes an array of training data along with optional configuration parameters. For example:<pre><code><b>const trainingData = [
          { input: [0, 0], output: [0] },
          { input: [0, 1], output: [1] },
          { input: [1, 0], output: [1] },
          { input: [1, 1], output: [0] }
        ];
        net.train(trainingData);</b></code></pre>
        <b>5.</b>Testing and Evaluation:
        After training the neural network, you can test its performance using testing data that it hasn't seen before. This will help you evaluate how well the neural network has learned to generalize from the training data. You can use the run() method to make predictions based on input data. For example:<pre><code><b>const output = net.run([0, 1]);<br>console.log(output); // Output: [0.987]</b></code></pre>
        <b>6.</b>Fine-tuning:
        Depending on the performance of your neural network, you may need to fine-tune its parameters, such as the number of hidden layers, learning rate, and activation functions. Experiment with different configurations to achieve the desired results.<br>
        <b>7.</b>Integration with Frontend:
        Finally, integrate your trained neural network into your frontend application. You can use JavaScript to interact with the neural network and provide AI-driven features to your users, such as predictive text suggestions or personalized recommendations.<br>

        <h3>TensorFlow.js</h3>              
    </div> 
    <div class="info-card-body">
      <p><b>1.</b><b>TensorFlow.js</b>Tallows frontend developers to integrate machine learning models directly into web applications using JavaScript. It's particularly useful for tasks like image and text recognition.<br>
        <h4><b>How to use TensorFlow.js for new user</b></h4>
        <b>1.</b>Install TensorFlow.js:
        Start by including TensorFlow.js in your web project. You can add it to your HTML file by including the following script tag: 
        <pre><code><b>< script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs@3"></script></b></code></pre>Alternatively, you can install TensorFlow.js via npm:<pre><code><b>npm install @tensorflow/tfjs</b></code></pre>Then, import it into your JavaScript file:<pre><code>import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';</code></pre>
        <b>2.</b>Choose or Train a Model:
        You can either choose a pre-trained model for your task or train your own using TensorFlow.js. For beginners, starting with a pre-trained model is recommended. TensorFlow.js provides several pre-trained models for tasks like image classification, object detection, and natural language processing.<br>
        <b>3.</b>Load Pre-trained Model:
        Use TensorFlow.js to load the pre-trained model of your choice. For example, to load a pre-trained image classification model like MobileNet, you can use the following code:<pre><code>const model = await tf.loadLayersModel('https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_130_224/classification/4');</code></pre>Make sure to replace the URL with the appropriate URL for the model you want to use.<br>
        <b>4.</b>Preprocess Data:
        Before feeding data into the model, you may need to preprocess it according to the model's requirements. For image recognition tasks, preprocess images by resizing, normalizing, and converting them to tensors.<br>
        <b>5.</b>Perform Inference:
        Once the model is loaded and the data is preprocessed, you can perform inference to make predictions. Pass the input data to the model's predict function and obtain the output predictions.<pre><code>const predictions = model.predict(inputData);</code></pre>
        <b>6.</b>Handle Predictions:
        Depending on the task, handle the model predictions accordingly. For image recognition, you can interpret the output probabilities to determine the predicted class labels. For text recognition, you can process the output to extract relevant information.<br>
        <b>7.</b>Display Results:
        Finally, display the results of the model predictions in your web application. This could involve showing the predicted class labels for images, highlighting recognized text in images, or any other relevant visualization based on the task.<br>
        <b>8.</b>Optimize Performance:
        Consider optimizing the performance of your TensorFlow.js application by leveraging techniques such as model quantization, WebGL acceleration, and batching inference requests.<br>
        <b>9.</b>Test and Debug:
        Test your TensorFlow.js application thoroughly to ensure that it behaves as expected. Use browser developer tools to debug any issues that arise during development.<br>
